# Overview of the analysis:
Last Summer, I and Kate (friends of mine) took the trip to New York City for two full weeks. Exploring historic landmarks like Central Park, The Status of Liberty, and the Empire State Building. It was a magical experience and as we flew home, we had a realization that one of the key ingredients to the magin was an unlikely suspect, Citi Bike. We had biked everywhere which allowed us to really get to know the city and interact with the people. A gem of an idea starts to form in our mind that what if we could start a similar bike share business for our hometown of Des Moines, Iowa. We have eyes on one investor who might be interested in providing seed funding to explore. There is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.
* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
